# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I'm still a newbie in the DEV World, so today I started the HTML & CSS Course from Curso em Vídeo on Youtube. Every class we have some exercises to do. I was able to finish 01 to 10 exercises and I completed the first 7 challenges.

**Thoughts:** So far, I'm doing pretty good with HTML. I don't think it'll be hard to be learned.
