# 100 Days Of Code - Log

#### Day 1: June 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I'm still a newbie in the DEV World, so today I started the HTML & CSS Course from Curso em Vídeo on Youtube. Every class we have some exercises to do. I was able to finish 01 to 10 exercises and I completed the first 6 challenges.

**Thoughts:** So far, I'm doing pretty good with HTML. I don't think it'll be hard to be learned.

#### Day 2: June 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today was not a productive day. It's frustrating, but at the same time I know it's part of the process. I completed @Curso em Vídeo HTML e CSS - Module I, doing all exercises and challenges. 
Also, I started to read "Code Clean".

**Thoughts:** Unproductive day, but I could understand the entire Module without any doubts.
